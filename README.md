CS 300 Module Eight Journal

The main problem we were solving with the projects in this course was how to incoporate different data structures into an application. With each data structure, there is many considerations taken like how algorithms are written and the underlying structure of the data structure.

I approached the problem by first intializing the data structure and all of its supporting variables and methods. Then, build out the auxillary methods, testing every step of the way. The reason data structures are important to understand because it can optimize the design of your application by taking advantage of the characteristics of a data structure.

One of the main roadblocks I encountered was the sorting method. I was trying to institute a selection sort algoritm but couldn't get it to work. I was able to find a solution on stackoverflow that was only two lines long, and tweaked it to fit for this application.

This project has expanded my approach to designing software by forcing me to work on small pieces of code, testing, debugging, then continue with the rest of code. Testing was a huge part of this project and will be for my projects going forward.

This project has evolved the way I write programs by including more comments while being concsise with each comment. Comments are helpful but I have found what is most effective for me is including a small summary of what the code is doing, rather than a larger one explaining every detail. I used to waste time overexplaining things that are obvious for even a novice developer.
